# DataSON PR Integration - Quick Reference

## 🚀 **What You Need to Know**

### **Setup (One-Time)**
1. Add workflow file to DataSON repo: `.github/workflows/pr-performance-check.yml`
2. Create GitHub token with `repo` + `actions:write` permissions
3. Add token as `BENCHMARK_REPO_TOKEN` secret

### **What Happens on Every PR**
1. **Builds DataSON wheel** from your PR branch
2. **Runs optimized benchmark suite** (5 datasets, ~3 minutes)
3. **Posts detailed comment** with performance analysis
4. **Blocks merge** if critical regressions detected (>30%)
