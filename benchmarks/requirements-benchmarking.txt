# Benchmarking Dependencies for Datason Performance Testing
# ========================================================
# These are ONLY for performance testing and competitive analysis.
# Do NOT include these in the main datason dependencies.

# Core ML Libraries (for realistic data science testing)
numpy>=1.24.0
pandas>=2.0.0

# Competitive Serialization Libraries (for competitive analysis)
orjson>=3.9.0      # Fastest JSON library (Rust-based)
ujson>=5.8.0       # Fast JSON library (C-based)
msgpack>=1.0.7     # Binary serialization format

# Optional ML Libraries (for comprehensive testing)
# Note: PyTorch should be installed separately with:
# pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
#
# For full ML integration testing, also install:
# scikit-learn>=1.3.0
# tensorflow>=2.13.0

# Performance Profiling Tools
# memory_profiler>=0.61.0
# line_profiler>=0.4.1
# py-spy>=0.3.14

# Note: Install with: pip install -r requirements-benchmarking.txt
# For PyTorch: pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
